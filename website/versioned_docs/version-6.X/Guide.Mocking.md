Mocking is an important part of testing. You may want to alter some behavior of your app during test and replace it with a mock. Here are some example reasons why this could be useful:

* Change server endpoints to point to a mock/staging server instead of the regular production server
* Stub a feature the simulator doesn't support, like push notifications
* Prepare mock environment data like GPS position, Contacts/Photos found on the device, etc

Note that mocking in end-to-end tests like in Detox is very different from mocking in unit tests like in Jest. With unit tests, the mocks can change between test case to test case. With Detox, remember that we're building the app once before all tests start. This means that mocks cannot be replaced between test cases. We'll have to assume our mock remains static during all test cases.

We'll only concentrate on mocking by changing JavaScript files under React Native apps.

[`react-native-repackager`](https://github.com/wix/react-native-repackager) is a great tool for this job. It extends the React Native packagerâ€™s ability to override JavaScript files with different extensions. Just like you can create `myFile.ios.js` and `myFile.android.js`, you'll be able to create `myFile.e2e.js` that will take over during Detox tests. This even works under `node_modules` which means we can publish libraries that contain ready-made mock implementations.

This replacement mechanism provides a lot of flexibility to change implementations for testing without affecting your production code. For more information and detailed usage instructions, [read the docs](https://github.com/wix/react-native-repackager/blob/master/README.md).

**Note:** Repackager is currently only available for RN 0.44. We are planning to update it soon for modern RN versions.
