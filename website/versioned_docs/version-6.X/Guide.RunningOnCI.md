> When your test suite is finally ready, it should be set up to run automatically on your CI server on every git push. This will alert you if new changes to the app break existing functionality.

Running detox on CI is not that different from running it locally. There are two main differences:

1.  We will test a release build rather than a debug build
2.  We will tell Detox to shut down the simulator when test is over

<br>

## Step 1: Prepare a release configuration for your app

We will need to create a [release device configuration for Detox](/docs/APIRef.Configuration.md#device-configuration) inside `package.json` under the `detox` section.

**Example:**

```json
"detox": {
  "configurations": {
    "ios.sim.release": {
      "binaryPath": "ios/build/Build/Products/Release-iphonesimulator/example.app",
      "build": "xcodebuild -project ios/example.xcodeproj -scheme example -configuration Release -sdk iphonesimulator -derivedDataPath ios/build",
      "type": "ios.simulator",
      "name": "iPhone 7"
    }
  }
}
```

> TIP: Notice that the name `example` above should be replaced with your actual project name.

<br>

## Step 2: Add build and test commands to your CI script

Assuming your CI is executing some sort of shell script, add the following commands that should run inside the project root:

```sh
detox build --configuration ios.sim.release
detox test --configuration ios.sim.release --cleanup
```

> TIP: Adding `--cleanup` to the test command will make sure detox exits cleanly by shutting down the simulator when the test is over.

## Appendix

### • Running Detox on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)

Detox's own build is running on Travis, check out Detox's [.travis.yml](/.travis.yml) file to see how it's done.

This is a simple example configuration to get you started with Detox on Travis:

```yaml
language: objective-c
osx_image: xcode8.3

branches:
  only:
  - master

env:
  global:
  - NODE_VERSION=stable

install:
- curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.2/install.sh | bash
- export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm" && [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
- nvm install $NODE_VERSION
- nvm use $NODE_VERSION

- npm install -g react-native-cli
- npm install -g detox-cli

script:
- detox build --configuration ios.sim.release
- detox test --configuration ios.sim.release --cleanup
```

### • Running Detox on [Bitrise](https://www.bitrise.io/)

Bitrise is a popular CI service for automating React Native apps. If you are looking to get started with Bitrise, check out [this](http://blog.bitrise.io/2017/07/25/how-to-set-up-a-react-native-app-on-bitrise.html) guide.

You can run Detox on Bitrise by creating a new workflow. Below is an example of the Bitrise **.yml** file for a workflow called `tests`.

Additionally, you can use a [webhook](http://devcenter.bitrise.io/webhooks/) on Bitrise to post the build status directly into your Slack channel.
