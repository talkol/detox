We have some very interesting plans for Detox, this is the place to discuss and share them.

### Android support - read more [here](More.AndroidSupportStatus.md)
The current API supports addition of multiple platforms, Android is next. This is the biggest feature we'll be working on in the near future. Supporting both Android emulators and devices. Our plan is to use both Espresso and UIAutomator as drivers. Espresso for core in-app interactions and synchronization with react-native, and UIAutomator for peripherals (notification panel, permission dialogs etc.). This will grant us both the speed and precision of Espresso, and the flexibility of UIAutomator.

### iOS physical device support
Currently Detox only supports running on iOS simulators, we plan on adding support for running on devices as well.

### Windows support
There is some work done for running Detox on Windows, but it's still fairly untested. Please open issues for anything you run into, but be aware of these limitations:

- Apple doesn't support iOS apps on Windows, so you're limited to the in-progress Android support.
- `binaryPath` can be left as a relative path with `/`, or use `\\` if you don't need cross-platform support.
- `build` should not use `./gradlew ...`, but simply `gradlew ...` - you may prefer scripting the build outside of Detox if you want to maintain cross-platform support - or simply have two configurations!

### Expectations on device logs
One of our most wanted features, being able to assert log outputs.

### Performance probing - [Detox Instruments](https://github.com/wix/detoxinstruments)
Maintaining performance is hard, The main issue with it is that by the time you notice there's a degradation in performance there's already so much changed it's hard to find a clear culprit for this regression (probably many small ones). Just like in BI, you wonâ€™t know if your change degrades or improves performance unless it is measured.

* **Measure vital signs while running tests.**
E2E is the perfect environment to measure, tests are repetitive, isolated, and run in lab conditions, and remove lots of variables from the equation.
* **Set threshold for measurements.**
Expect your E2E scenario to use a specific amount of resources.
* **Compare measurements to previous builds.**
Know exactly when the regression have happened

#### (Partial) list of measurements we'd like to have:
network bandwidth/calls, thread count, js thread cpu ticks, memory cpu, size on disk, binary size, react component render count, message count on the bridge, disk I/O


### Failed test artifacts
Add the following to an artifact directory for each failed test. This has

1. Video of the test from start to finish
2. Screenshot when a test failed
2. Device log
3. Print hierarchy with testIDs
