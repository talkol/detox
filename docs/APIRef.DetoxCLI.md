### test

Initiating your test suite. <sup>[[1]](#notice-passthrough)</sup>

`detox test [options] <...testFilePaths>`

| Option                                        | Description |
| ---                                           | --- |
| -c, -configuration \<device config\>          | Select a device configuration from your defined configurations, if not supplied, and there's only one configuration, detox will default to it |
| -o, --runner-config \<config\>                | Test runner config file, defaults to 'e2e/mocha.opts' for mocha and 'e2e/config.json' for jest. |
| -n, --device-name [name]                      | Override the device name specified in a configuration. Useful for running a single build configuration on multiple devices. |

##### Notices

1. <a name="notice-passthrough">It</a> should be noted that `detox test` is a convenience method to trigger an execution
of a supported test runner, so for the most part it reads configuration from CLI args and `package.json` and remaps it
to command-line arguments or environment variables that are supported by (or not conflict with) the test runner.
Hence, **extra arguments to** `detox test` **will be forwarded to your test runner**, e.g:

    * You run `detox test --bail`, and since `--bail` is an unknown option, it will be forwarded to the test runner as-is.
    * If there is a name conflict for some option (between the test runner and `detox test`), you can pass it explicitly
    after the reserved `--` sequence. For instance, `detox test -- --help`, will pass `--help` to the test runner CLI
    itself.

2. <a name="notice-artifacts">If</a> `--artifacts-location` path does not end with a slash (`/`) or a backslash, then detox CLI will append to the
path a subdirectory with configuration name and timestamp (e.g. `artifacts/android.emu.release.2018-06-12 05:52:43Z`).
In other words, the path with a slash at the end assumes you do not want a subdirectory inside.
For more details, please check the [Enabling artifacts](APIRef.Artifacts.md#artifacts).
The default value is **artifacts** (plus a subdir). 

### run-server

Start a standalone Detox server

`detox run-server [options]`

| --- | --- |
| -p, --port [port]      | Port number (default: 8099) |
| -l, --loglevel [value] | Log level: fatal, error, warn, info, verbose, trace |
| --no-color             | Disable colorful logs |
| --help                 | Show help |
